# Lab 6 — Creating a Sprite

You’re creating a 3-frame sprite in Photoshop — either in a row or a column — then creating a web page to display each frame in the sprite as a background in the opposite order of the sprite. For example, if you create your sprite as a row, then your web page should appear as a column, and vice versa. Review CSS’s `background` property while you do this lab.

Add your flattened sprite file to a folder called `img`. **Do not place PSD files in this repo.**

The `lab-6` folder contains your starter code. **Submit this lab by issuing a pull request to the original repo by 12:40 PM on Thursday, 30 November 2017**.
